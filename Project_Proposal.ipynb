We also don't anticipate a problem with the number of attributes, since there are only 12. If anything we will choose a couple of the best attributes that we believe will predict the quality the best."

Therefore, these results could potentially be used to help wine makers set the perfect conditions for their wines in order to ensure the best quality is produced. The biggest stakeholders would be wine makers and wine snobs."
